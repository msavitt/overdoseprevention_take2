<h1> As Overdoses Rise, NY Harm Reduction Advocates See Need for Federal Aid </h1>
<h2> NYC opened the nation's first recognized safe consumption sites. Now groups are seeking passage of bills to prevent overdoses in every neighborhood. </h2>
      <h3> by Michayla Savitt </h3>

<p> On Nov. 7, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nvss/vsrr/drug-overdose-data.htm"> the CDC announced</a> another staggering new death count in the U.S. amid the pandemic: 100,000 lethal drug overdoses between April 2020-2021. In Brooklyn, groups like Voices Of Community Activists & Leaders (VOCAL-NY) are working to help curb these preventable deaths among residents, and are pushing for long-term solutions. </p>

<p>Once a week, “peers” with VOCAL-NY occupy Brownsville street corners to distribute clean syringes, fentanyl test strips, and naloxone to participants. </p>

<p>“A lot of people don't want to go into a [treatment] building because they don't want to be stigmatized,” Paula Santiago, VOCAL-NY associate outreach and peer education coordinator said. “So they will prefer to do a quick transaction on the street.”</p>

<p>Santiago said that participants will sometimes not trust service providers. Her group’s work is different – many of the peers are community members who were once in the shoes of those they’re helping.</p>

<p>Among Brownsville residents, the <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/epi/databrief129.pdf"> 2020 rate of unintentional drug poisoning [overdose] deaths</a> is above New York City’s average, at 30.8 per 100,000 residents. The city-wide rise in overdose deaths is still at its highest yet.</p>

<p>“Overdoses are common, but we’ve saved a lot of lives,” Darryl Roberson, a senior peer, noted. “Down the road, we can defeat it, but we need a lot of support.” </p>

  <p> VOCAL-NY is among the 240 civil rights, drug policy, and criminal justice reform organizations across the nation now calling for passage of federal legislation that could help prevent opioid deaths in every neighborhood. In <a href="https://u7061146.ct.sendgrid.net/ls/click?upn=4tNED-2FM8iDZJQyQ53jATUdYu6uSLwisXOqaubFTTGnendvgQ83JXO9RDh-2F-2F27cCuoaPDLXSLER1pCt-2BljgxnrZrFEjr6lFmwkDmbBtGyDtmzAxBpevHoCk5UmRyMBP-2FS2A-2B7uN5-2FrUNjBLzMhSD4hg-3D-3DzsCo_XuX6jWVvgcIf0zp3q8IBZl2Q4EYUIypVWh6aZY7HAH5iHJgVqBXTiZ9DeGTT2nvesPI8vN31RU-2F8kzlNtBQ4G0ezlgY8ddG78K-2FRCbmKXP9-2Bq-2FcmmMP5pPCFmj28DLVZ-2F0KBm0ewDn-2BcAxmUlCytraI0dtymXfiNTdre3le2-2B6pPKCpKENmKYWScqI5tgG05mFC8LdF0wj36-2BsxRGfZXQ4kmjt6gfTrSTjWheEmIv3jvQHfEAlkBro0wrgtbbbT7Ajok-2Fwwnbaddj66q6ruHoGWkUjxx6lLXcXQ37hTxjIEK4fNY59cwkWjENKdIuyYLYQaO74lklr-2FCvVLvWghq2BzlSeAiqt9qdRqTo0ki-2Bco-3D"> a letter sent to Congress </a> Nov. 30, advocates pushed for $69.5 million to be put towards increasing access to overdose prevention, harm reduction, and syringe service programs through the CDC’s Infectious Diseases and the Opioid Epidemic program.</p>

  <p>The letter also called for swift passage of the federal <a href="https://tinyurl.com/yt8sbnaySTOP"> Fentanyl Act</a>, which improves surveillance and detection of the potent drug. According to <a href="https://tinyurl.com/mryh6y8z"> a NYC Health Department report</a>, fentanyl was involved in 77% of opioid-involved overdoses, and is the most common substance found in all overdose deaths. Moore explained the presence of fentanyl in illicit drug batches is a further reason for people-first approach to addiction.</p>

  <p>“We need a lot more shifting away from criminalization, and from tactics from the failed drug war that have really been ineffective, and a move to person-centered health policies,” Melissa Moore, director of Civil Systems Reform at Drug Policy Alliance said.</p>

  <p>This year marks the 50th anniversary of former President Nixon declaring the <a href="https://drugpolicy.org/issues/brief-history-drug-war"> “war on drugs”</a> which criminalized certain drugs, and disproportionately impacted communities of color. The disparities continue even now.</p>

  <p>“There's a really devastating feedback loop that we see in neighborhoods like Mott Haven and Brownsville,” Moore explained. “Officers use their discretion in ways that are very different from other neighborhoods across the city. We know that people use and sell drugs at pretty similar rates across different demographic populations.”</p>

  <p>Now, New York City has taken drastic action to prevent overdoses by opening the nation’s <a href=" https://www1.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/793-21/mayor-de-blasio-nation-s-first-overdose-prevention-center-services-open-new-yorkfirst"> first publicly recognized safe consumption sites </a> on Nov. 30. The Overdose Prevention Centers (OPCs) allows people to safely use drugs, receive medical care, and have their supply inspected for fentanyl. Centers also connect people to treatment programs and social services.

      <div class="text"> <iframe title="2018 ER visits for fatal &amp;amp; non-fatal opioid overdoses in NYC" aria-label="Map" id="datawrapper-chart-MJNOt" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/MJNOt/6/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="727"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();

<p> The centers were in upper Manhattan, because of the high concentration of overdoses seen in East Harlem and Washington Heights. However, Ocean Hill and Brownsville generally see a high impact of opioids in the community, with 532 cases of opioid abuse, dependence, outpatient emergency room visits, and both fatal and non fatal overdoses per 100,000 people. </p>

<p>Most recent data broken down by zip code shows neighborhoods in the Bronx, Staten Island, and central and south Brooklyn have similar or larger rates. Jamaica, Queens, has an extremely high crude rate because there is a very small population but only about 10 cases.</p>

<p>Moore said the high numbers follow a similar trend.</p>

<p>“We know that these are the same neighborhoods that have been starved for resources and have been disinvested from over decades,” she said.</p>

<p>Research has shown OPCs to effectively <a href="https://www.emcdda.europa.eu/system/files/publications/2734/POD_Drug%20consumption%20rooms.pdf"> prevent lethal overdoses for decades </a> in other countries. However, Moore said the need is clear in all five boroughs.</p>

<p>“We know that that's going to be the thing that will actually save lives at this moment,” she added.</p>

<p>The New York City Mayor’s Office did not return a request for information about future OPC locations or dates. The first supervised injection site won’t have a big reach to Brownsville, since it’s over an hour away. Santiago says that’s why VOCAL-NY’s peer work is so vital: they meet people where they are.</p>

<p>Still, Santiago feels her group has not been able to have as much of an impact on the Brownsville community because of limited resources. VOCAL-NY is doing what they can, with the supplies they have, to provide people-first treatment on more Brooklyn streets.</p>

<p>“I think marginalized populations are people that are in need of people who actually give a damn, who actually care,” Santiago said.</p>
